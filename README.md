# Unarmoured African FIA Replacement

[Unarmoured African FIA Replacement - Arma Reforger Workshop](https://reforger.armaplatform.com/workshop/628EADAA424F77A0-AfricanFIAUnarmoured)

Sister mod of the [African FIA Replacement - Arma Reforger Workshop](https://reforger.armaplatform.com/workshop/624A8B96AA67EFEB-ATMAfricanFIAReplacement).

On popular request, this one introduces soldiers without body armour and helmets.

The intent of this project is also to provide a lightweight and reliable INDFOR solution in a Southern African region environment.

The additional features are :
- [x] No more helmets nor body armour. They've got more rizz though.
- [x] Machine-Gunner and Anti-Tank Assistants rose up to Junior level position. Less skilled than their Senior counterpart.
- [x] Ammunition Bearer retasked as a Grenadier. With a bag full of hand grenades.
- [x] Vehicles in "Drunken Earthworms" camouflage. (I love your naming patter, BI! ;) ).
- [x] Green flag.

But the camouflage, the intent here is to optimize their abilities as a PVE opposing force.

The new features will percolate back to the OG mod in due time.

Known issues
- [ ] unknwon.


Future
- [ ] moar adaptationz.

What else ?
